Question 3: By default do django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller? 
Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code 
does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

code
from django.db import transaction
from django.dispatch import Signal, receiver

my_signal = Signal()

@receiver(my_signal)
def my_signal_handler(sender, **kwargs):
    print("Signal handler executed!")
    # Example of a database operation
    # SomeModel.objects.create(field=value)

# Using a transaction
with transaction.atomic():
    print("Before sending the signal")
    my_signal.send(sender=None)
    print("After sending the signal")
