Question 1: By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? Please 
support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does 
not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic
#code

from django.dispatch import Signal, receiver
# Define a signal
my_signal = Signal()

@receiver(my_signal)
def my_signal_handler(sender, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received!")

# Sending the signal
print("Before sending the signal")
my_signal.send(sender=None)
print("After sending the signal")
