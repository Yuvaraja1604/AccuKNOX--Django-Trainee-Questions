Question 2: Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your 
answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be 
elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic. 

#code
import threading
from django.dispatch import Signal, receiver

my_signal = Signal()

@receiver(my_signal)
def my_signal_handler(sender, **kwargs):
    print(f"Signal received in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")

# Emitting the signal
print(f"Before sending the signal in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
my_signal.send(sender=None)
print(f"After sending the signal in thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
